## BlueMelons
  It just turns the melons blue. A good 'hello world' type mod to make sure everything is working. Note that this mod modifies crops.xnb and springobjects.xnb so it will conflict with other mods that also change those files.

## [CP] Purpus
  A "content patcher" file. If you have the content patcher mod, and this folder is placed in your Mods folder, it will be loaded. This mod adds a new npc named Purpus. A purple Krobus lookalike.
